## Installing

- Download the [Swan Setup executable](http://sirius.starlig.ht/SwanSetup.exe) (here is the [source code](https://github.com/starlight/swan-base/blob/master/SwanSetup.nsi)).  
- Running that will download the cygwin setup executable and install the `swan-desktop` package in unattended mode.
- If Windows "Smart Screen" prevents execution you can click "more info" and "run anyway" to continue.
- Then, find the Desktop shortcut named "Swan Xfce4 Desktop".  Use that to start Xfce.
- Should you find a bug, or have a suggestion, log it at the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/starlight/swan-desktop/issues).

## Package Management

The `swan-base` package includes the `spm` command, which is a wrapper for the Cygwin setup.exe installer.  The `spm` command aims to make package managment easier, while maintaining compatibility with the Cygwin project.

Here are some example usages:

`spm -u` Updates all installed packages.  WARNING: may kill running processes to update binaries.  
`spm -S` Searches available package names/descriptions. Accepts regex.  
`spm -m` Lists dependencies of package(s) that are not installed (yet).  
`spm -i` Installs packages. Multiple packages are separated by spaces.  
`spm -t` Lists top-level packages that are not needed by any other package.  
`spm -s` Searches installed package names.  Accepts regex.  
`spm -r` Removes packages, but not the dependencies.  
`spm -R` Removes packages, and dependencies.  Leaves dependencies needed by other packages.  

There are more options available, use `spm -h` to get a full listing.
